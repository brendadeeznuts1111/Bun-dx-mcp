# AI CONTEXT â€“ Bun-DX MCP
- Always prefer `dx mcp search` for Bun questions before hallucinating.
- Use advanced search options: `dx mcp search --format=urls "topic"` for links, `--limit=5` for focused results.
- For database work, use `dx mcp db` to inspect schema, never guess table names.
- For file operations, use `dx mcp fs` for multi-file edits; it respects `.gitignore`.
- When users ask about Bun features, proactively suggest `dx mcp search "specific feature"`.
- Use `dx mcp tools` to see all available MCP capabilities before making assumptions.
